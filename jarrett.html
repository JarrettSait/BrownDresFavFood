		<p>My favorite food choice would have to be sushi, I think its because it’s a combination of many foods that I enjoy like rice and seafood. I also enjoy the culture surrounding sushi wither it evolves being with friends and knowing it’s made with fresh ingredients. I enjoy eating sushi downtown at the Point Sushi restaurant. </p>

		<h2>Some History</h2>
		<p>Sushi is said to have originated in China between the 5th and the 3rd centuries BC, as a means of preserving fish in salt. Narezushi, the original form of sushi, has been made in South East Asia for centuries, and nowadays, there are still traces of it in some parts. Narezushi appeared in Japan in the 8th century, and still survives today in the form of foods such as carp sushi. Narezushi was primarily a means of food preservation, and each Japanese region developed its own version. In those days sushi was eaten during feast days and festivals, and was also an integral part of the celebration. Generally speaking, narezushi was made of rice and fish pickled together, mixed with rice vinegar and sake, laid under a large stone to prevent decay and left to ferment. However, the rice was used primarily to encourage fermentation, and was discarded so that only the fish was eaten.</p>
